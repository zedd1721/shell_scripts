# Project 1: File Organizer
### Write a script that organizes files in a directory by file type.
##### Features:
- Accept a directory path as input.
- List all files in the directory.
- Based on file extensions (`.txt`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, etc.), move them into respective folders (e.g., `"TextFiles"`, `"Images"`, `"Documents"`).
- If the folders do not exist, create them.
- Report how many files have been moved to each folder.
